# Rock Paper Scissors
This is the *Rock Paper Scissors* project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors).

## Sumary
This was a quick little project where I've mainly practiced creating functions, using their return values and using console.log() to check if my functions behave correctly.
